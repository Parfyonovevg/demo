          How long does it take for an average person to fall asleep?
        </h3>
        <p class="answer">
          This usually lasts for 5-10 minutes. Research has shown that the
          average sleeper takes about 7 minutes to fall asleep. You may fall
          asleep sooner, or take longer. The second stage of sleep lasts about
          20 minutes.

          Which president survived two assassination attempts?
        </h3>
        <p class="answer">
          President Ford survived two assassination attempts in the same month.
          On Sept. 5, 1975, Lynette Fromme, a follower of Charles Manson, fired
          a pistol at the president in a crowd in Sacramento, but Ford was
          unharmed. On Sept. 22, Sara Jane Moore pulled a revolver on Ford in
          San Francisco.

        <h3 class="faq-title">How many teeth does a cow have?</h3>
        <p class="answer">
          Cow's teeth are different from ours. On the top front, cows have a
          tough pad of skin instead of teeth. They have 8 incisors on the bottom
          front and 6 strong molars on the top and bottom of each side to grind
          their food. Cows have a total of 32 teeth.
